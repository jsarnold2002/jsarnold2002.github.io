    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Spider monkeys are a species of New World monkeys known for their long, slender limbs and prehensile tails. They belong to the Atelidae family and are native to the tropical forests of Central and South America.</p>

    <h2 id="characteristics">Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Spider monkeys have a distinctive appearance characterized by their long, spindly limbs, and a tail that acts like a fifth limb. They have a small face with a flat nose and large eyes. Their fur can vary in color from black to brown to gold, depending on the species.</p>

    <h2 id="habitat">Habitat</h2>
    <p>These monkeys inhabit dense, evergreen rainforests and tropical forests. They are highly arboreal and are rarely seen on the ground. Spider monkeys are found in countries such as Mexico, Central America, and parts of South America.</p>

    <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
    <p>Spider monkeys are social animals that live in groups called troops. They are primarily frugivorous, meaning they mainly eat fruits, but they also consume leaves, flowers, and insects. Their prehensile tail is an essential tool for swinging between branches and grasping objects.</p>

    <h2 id="conservation">Conservation Status</h2>
    <p>Spider monkeys face various threats, including habitat destruction due to deforestation and illegal wildlife trade. Several species of spider monkeys are listed as endangered or vulnerable by conservation organizations.</p>

    <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
